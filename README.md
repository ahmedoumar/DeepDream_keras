# DeepDream Keras and tensorflow


In this IPython Notebook i have implemented the Deep Dream algorithm from google paper .

In this notebook i used a pretrained InceptionV3 model, and used it for my DeepDream architecture where i have trained the model on my local gpu(which is something painefull) using keras as an API and tensorflow as a backend framework.

Note:
This work is inspired from francoit cholle Deep learning with python book.
